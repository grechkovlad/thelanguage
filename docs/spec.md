# The Language

## Type system

There are primitive types and reference types. Primitive types are `int`, `bool`, `float`, `char`. Reference types are
classes (
including interfaces)
and arrays.

## OOP

Inheritance, ad-hoc polymorphism and encapsulation are supported.

Inheritance rules are similar to Java.

Interfaces can contain only methods.

## Project structure

Project is a directory with sources. No nesting is allowed.
